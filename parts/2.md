## Extensible code

In part 1 we saw a simple implementation of a linked list, but it only works with a particular structure:

```c
struct node {
	int value;
	struct node *next;
};
```

What happens when the value is not an `int`, but a `float`? Or we want a more complex structure:

```c
struct node {
	int id;
	const char *name;
	struct node *next;
};
```

## GLib

Let's take a look to a real implementation from a real library: [GLib][glib] (not to be confused
with [glibc][glibc]). GLib is the fundamental library every GNOME and GTK+ project uses, and
fortunately for our purses it's implemented in C.

```c
typedef void* gpointer;
typedef struct _GSList GSList;

struct _GSList
{
  gpointer data;
  GSList *next;
};

GSList*
g_slist_remove_link (GSList *list,
                     GSList *link)
{
  GSList *tmp = NULL;
  GSList **previous_ptr = &list;

  while (*previous_ptr)
    {
      tmp = *previous_ptr;
      if (tmp == link)
        {
          *previous_ptr = tmp->next;
          tmp->next = NULL;
          break;
        }

      previous_ptr = &tmp->next;
    }

  return list;
}
```

I personally can't stand this style, so let's clean it up:

```c
typedef struct GSList {
	void *data;
	struct GSList *next;
} GSList;

GSList *g_slist_remove_link(GSList *list, GSList *link)
{
	GSList *tmp = NULL;
	GSList **previous_ptr = &list;

	while (*previous_ptr) {
		tmp = *previous_ptr;
		if (tmp == link) {
			*previous_ptr = tmp->next;
			tmp->next = NULL;
			break;
		}

		previous_ptr = &tmp->next;
	}

	return list;
}
```

This looks very similar to our good taste version, except it's using a `tmp` pointer.

Let's use `p` instead of `previous_ptr` and replace `tmp` with it when possible:

```c
GSList *tmp = NULL;
GSList **p = &list;

while (*p) {
	tmp = *p;
	if (*p == link) {
		*p = (*p)->next;
		tmp->next = NULL;
		break;
	}

	p = &(*p)->next;
}

return list;
```

Now it is clear that `tmp` is only really used to clear the `next` pointer of the node we want to
remove. This is something that should be done by the user of this function if
it's wanted, which more like is not because the node will be disposed of, so
let's move that unnecessary code.

```c
GSList **p = &list;

while (*p) {
	if (*p == link) {
		*p = (*p)->next;
		break;
	}

	p = &(*p)->next;
}

return list;
```

We are getting close to our clean code.

We can move the break comparison `*p == link` into the `while` condition, and update `*p` after the
loop:

```c
GSList **p = &list;

while (*p && *p != link)
	p = &(*p)->next;

*p = (*p)->next;

return list;
```

At this point we have made too many changes to be comfortable without running any tests.

## Tests

Let's try to port our unit tests from part 1 to GLib's single linked list.

First, let's look at the structures:

```c
struct node {
	int value;
	struct node *next;
};

struct GSList {
	void *data;
	struct GSList *next;
};
```

As we can see, the only real difference is that in our version the data (`int value`) was directly
available, in GLib's version `data` is a pointer to our data.

So, instead of initializing our node's data directly, we have to do do it indirectly:

```c
// Before
node a = { .value = 0 };

// After
node_data a = { .value = 0 };
GSList link_a = { .data = &a };
```

And of course, we have to define our `node_data` structure:

```c
struct node_data {
	int value;
};
```

So, our test looks like this:

```c
int do_test(void) {
	node_data a = { .value = 0 };
	node_data b = { .value = 1 };
	node_data c = { .value = 2 };

	GSList link_a = { .data = &a };
	GSList link_b = { .data = &b };
	GSList link_c = { .data = &c };

	link_a.next = &link_b;
	link_b.next = &link_c;

	GSList *list = &link_a;

	list = g_slist_remove_link(list, &link_b);
	if (link_a.next != &link_c) return false;

	list = g_slist_remove_link(list, &link_a);
	if (list != &link_c) return false;

	return true;
}
```

This test passes both with GLib's original version, and our cleaned up version. So we are good.

Not so fast.

## Unexpected behavior

One difference from part 1's code and our cleaned up code is the `while` condition:

```c
// Before
while (*p != entry)

// Now
while (*p && *p != link)
```

Have you spotted the problem?

What happens when `*p` is `NULL`?

It turns out Linus' version has a bug--or at least a missing feature. If we search for an entry that
doesn't exist, eventually we reach the end of the list, `*p` is `NULL`, we try to dereference
`NULL->next`, and we crash.

Now, it's debatable whether or not trying to remove a non-existing element is a valid use case, but
surely it does happen. In those cases would probably want to return an error (can't do it in this
API), show a warning (we would need a lot more infraestructure), or simply ignore the problem.

Either way crashing is never good, so we want to avoid that.

Our current tests aren't enough though, we need to search for an element that isn't in the list, for
example an element that we just removed:

```c
head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_b);
if (link_a.next != &link_c) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_a);
if (head != &link_c) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_a);
if (head != &link_c) return false;
```

Does the code works now? Nope, because we made a mistake refactoring:

```c
// This isn't the same
while (*p) {
	if (*p == link) {
		*p = (*p)->next;
		break;
	}

	p = &(*p)->next;
}

// As this:
while (*p && *p != link)
	p = &(*p)->next;

*p = (*p)->next;
```

The difference is that if `*p` is `NULL` we don't want to execute anything else, so we have to check
that `*p` isn't `NULL` at the end too:

```c
while (*p && *p != link)
	p = &(*p)->next;

if (*p) *p = (*p)->next;
```

Now the code is equivalent, but is that the only difference?

We can add more tests to make sure that passing `NULL` arguments works, and also removing all the
elements of the list:

```c
head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_b);
if (link_a.next != &link_c) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_a);
if (head != &link_c) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_a);
if (head != &link_c) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(head, NULL);
if (head != &link_c) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(head, &link_c);
if (head != NULL) return false;

head = g_slist_remove_link(NULL, NULL);
head = g_slist_remove_link(NULL, &link_c);
```

All the tests pass, so our refactored code is correct now.

## Conclusion

Now that we have a proper implementation that is extensible, we can use any structure we want, not
just a simple `int`.

It's as extensible as the implementation of a mainstream library (GLib), but it's simpler, has good
taste, and it works better than Linus Torvalds's naive implentation.

Is that all we can do? Turns out theres more, see [part 3](3.html).
